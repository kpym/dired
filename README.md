# Dired -- A directory browser in a Sublime Text 2 plugin

The main entry point is `Ctrl+Shift+d` which brings up a directory browser for the current directory (the directory of the current view).  You can then navigate to the next/previous line with the cursor keys, or with `n/p`, or with `j/k`.

You can open the file on the current line with `Enter`.  If there is a directory on the current line
depending on settings (Dired Preferences.sublime-settings):
	- a new browser view is created for that directory
	- or the directory is opened in the current browser view
